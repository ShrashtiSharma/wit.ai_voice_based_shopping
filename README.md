Online Shopping using Voice Assistant

Why dig the online store for the right product with right features, when your voice is enough to ask for it?

## Inspiration
What differentiates the offline shopping experience from the online? No hustles of searching and exploring through huge product descriptions for what you really need in that product. In offline shopping, the salesman is there to answer all of your questions. You can ask whatever you want to  know about the product. And, no denying, we humans love to just ask for what we need. Reading is inherently boring for us. But, online shopping is a lot of hard work. This is what inspired me and my team to do some of the job for the daily online shoppers.

## What it does
Whatever you want it to do. Okay, not now. But yes it can do a lot for online customers.

Ask for the product you need (Yes, no more typing) and it will get you to the right section. 
Choose the product of your interest and ask anything about the product for example itâ€™s price, features, availability, customer ratings or main highlights of the product.
It can also show you the Specials deals and Top products of the day.

## How I built it
We integrated **wit.ai** with an online shopping template. We added all the voice based functionalities using django as the backend. The frontend is based on HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and JavaScript. The model is trained to recognise and understand the voice using **wit.ai**

## Challenges I ran into

The main challenge was to integrate all the technologies. But after that, **wit.ai** worked well.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
When shopping experiences have changed a lot with every product just a few clicks away, we are proud that we made this experience even more ecstatic and engaging by removing the hustle to find the details of a product. Our project will allow users to find the information they are looking for by using their voice, giving them the experience of offline shopping and interacting with the salesman.

## What I learned
This project gave us a chance to learn and work with **wit.ai** which seems the next big thing in the NLP and Bot industry. This project allowed us to polish our existing skills while allowing us to develop new ones.

## What's next for Online Shopping using Voice Assistant
It can do only a few things for now because online shopping really includes a lot. But we believe online shopping will be really fun and engaging if most of the things can be done with the voice alone. So, we are going to add many more functionalities to our online shopping website. To mention some :-
Comparing the specifications of two or more products.
Allow users to add filters to their search query.
Adding products to the cart and most part of the checkout.
